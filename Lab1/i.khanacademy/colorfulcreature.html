        <p>The <em></em> is awesome because <strong></strong> <br>
        Horses see our inner selves. They don’t care if we are the President of a company or the janitor in the local school. <em>They see us as we really are.</em> There is no room for ego with your relationship with a horse. You have to earn their respect. <strong>You have to be honest with them and yourself.</strong>
