        <h1>O Captain! My captain!</h1>
        <p>O Captain! my Captain! our fearful trip is done, <br>
The ship has weather’d every rack, the prize we sought is won, <br>
The port is near, the bells I hear, the people all exulting, <br>
While follow eyes the steady keel, the vessel grim and daring; <br>
But O heart! heart! heart! <br>
O the bleeding drops of red, <br>
Where on the deck my Captain lies,  <br>
Fallen cold and dead.</p>
